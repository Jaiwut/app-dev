## Synopsis

*An ex-hitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that killed his dog, the last gift he got from his deceased wife.*

## Plot 
Former assassin John Wick loses his wife, Helen, to a terminal illness. After her death, John receives a puppy named Daisy as a gift from Helen to help him cope. However, he encounters Iosef Tarasov, the son of a Russian crime lord, who tries to buy his car. When John refuses, Iosef and his henchmen break into John's house, steal his car, and kill Daisy.

John seeks revenge and learns that Iosef is Viggo Tarasov's son. Viggo, understanding John's fury, beats Iosef and reveals John's notorious past as an assassin. Viggo attempts to convince John to spare Iosef, but John silently refuses. Viggo puts a bounty on John's head, and numerous assassins try to kill him.

John fights off the assassins sent by Viggo and seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, a criminal sanctuary. Winston, the hotel's owner, informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John assaults the nightclub but fails to kill Iosef due to the interference of Viggo's henchman, Kirill. John returns to the Continental for assistance and is targeted by another assassin, Ms. Perkins, who he subdues.

With information obtained from Ms. Perkins, John destroys Viggo's front organization and ambushes Viggo's men. However, they overpower John and capture him. Marcus intervenes and frees John, leading to a confrontation where John kills Kirill and forces Viggo to reveal Iosef's location. John heads to the safe house and eliminates Iosef and his bodyguards.

Ms. Perkins informs Viggo of John's connection with Marcus. Viggo tortures and kills Marcus and plans for Ms. Perkins to ambush John. However, she is executed by Winston for breaking the hotel's rules. Winston informs John that Viggo plans to escape by helicopter. John kills Viggo's henchmen and engages in a brutal fight with Viggo, ultimately killing him.

Injured, John stops at an animal clinic and rescues a pit bull puppy scheduled for euthanasia. He walks with the dog along the boardwalk, reminiscent of his last date with Helen.
